Beyond my academic and professional endeavors, I take delight in life’s quieter joys—sometimes as simple as gazing
out of a window and letting the world pass by. But I do have some hobbies too, where I do more than gazing.

## 🏏 Cricket
- Lifelong passion for the sport.
- Most valued achievements of my (cricketing) life: 
  - 🥉 Bronze Medal (as a captain) – Inter-IIT Sports Meet, 2017.
  - 🥇 Gold Medal – Inter-IIT Sports Meet, 2015.

## 🌍 Travel
