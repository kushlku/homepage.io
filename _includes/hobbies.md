## Hobbies
Beyond my academic and professional endeavors, I take delight in life’s simpler joys, sometimes as simple as gazing
out of a window. But I do have some hobbies too, where I do more than gazing.

### 🏏 Cricket
- Lifelong passion for the sport.
- Most valued achievements of my (cricketing) life: 
  - 🥉 Bronze Medal – Inter-IIT Sports Meet as captain, 2017.

### 📚 Reading & Intellectual Exploration
- Enjoy reading books on history of science, psychology and philosophy.  
- Some of my favorite books are:
  - *Think Again* by Adam Grant.  
  - *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari.  
- Actively engage in philosophical debates, exploring diverse perspectives on human behavior, existentialism, theology and meaning of life.
