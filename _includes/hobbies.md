## Hobbies
Beyond my academic and professional endeavors, I take delight in life’s simpler joys, sometimes as simple as gazing
out of a window. But I do have some hobbies too, where I do more than gazing.

### 🏏 Cricket
- Lifelong passion for the sport.
- Special Appreciation Award 2018, awarded by IITK Games and Sports Council for outstanding contribution to sporting community.

### 🌍 Travel
