Hi! I am an **Applied Scientist at Amazon** working on large-scale retrieval and multimodal AI systems.  
My work has been published in top-tier venues like SIGIR, and deployed at scale to improve search experiences for millions of customers.

I am preparing for an **MS in Computer Science** with a focus on AI/ML at Columbia, Stanford, and Georgia Tech.  
Here you can find my **[publications](/publications/)**, **[projects](/projects/)**, and **[CV](/cv/)**.
